# Summer-Learning-2017
## Personnal Site
### General idea of what I want to learn
1. Learn a web frame work
2. Learn test driven developement
3. Learn how to configure and deploy web servers
  * Learn CI practices
  * Create a set process for deployments from git and testing with minimal interation
### Specifics of the above
1. I will be using a MEAN stack because it will be fun and different
  * MongoDB
  * Express
  * Angular
  * NodeJS
2. I will have to figure this out as I go, I think this might be a stretch to finish before end of summer
3. This will be a part of learning the stack. I will continue to update my methodology as I go on

### How
1. Start with MEAN tutorials. I'll focus mostly on Angular and Express as a personnal site won't be all that dynamic right now probably spend 2-4 weeks on this.
2. Design the website on gravit.io(or find a better design tool)
3. Draft a deployment process and set up servers
4. Design software roughly
5. Implement
